# Financial Analysis with Python: A Comprehensive Tutorial

### Sara Mezuri

## Introduction

Python holds immense importance in the financial world due to its versatility, efficiency, and extensive ecosystem of libraries. Its readability and ease of integration make it a preferred language for rapidly developing and deploying sophisticated financial models, contributing significantly to the finance industry.
NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib play pivotal roles in the field of financial analysis by providing powerful tools for data manipulation, analysis, and visualization. 
NumPy's array-based computations help with numerical operations and assist in the implementation of complex financial models.
Pandas, because of its DataFrame structure, help simplify data manipulation and cleaning and transform financial datasets.
Matplotlib, as a plotting library, enables the creation of clear and insightful visualizations, essential for interpreting complex financial trends and patterns.

The primary goal of this project is to explore the world of financial analysis using Python, focusing on key libraries such as NumPy, Pandas and Matplotlib. The outcome of this project is to create a tutorial on the process of analyzing financial data and visualizing the result as well. 

## Background

For this project, my focus is on conducting a comprehensive analysis of the impact of COVID-19 on the European Stock Market. 
To achieve this, I will perform a thorough financial analysis of various stock indexes across Europe, more precisely: 

* EURO STOXX 50 (The index holds stocks from eight eurozone countries: Belgium, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, and Spain.)
* FTSE 100 (The FTSE 100 Index is a index of the 100 most highly capitalized companies traded on the London Stock Exchange.)
* DAX (The DAX is stock market index consisting of the 40 major German companies trading on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange.)
* CAC40 (The CAC 40 is the index of the largest 40 companies listed in France)
* FTSE MIB (The Index consists of the 40 stocks listed on the Milano Borsa Italiana.)
* SMI (The index SMI is the most important stock index in Switzerland and comprises the 20 largest stocks.) 
* IBEX 35 (The IBEX 35 is the official index of the Spanish Continuous Exchange, comprised of the 35 most liquid stocks.)

I plan to collect historical stock data from 2017 to 2022, aiming to recognize patterns and trends. Through a detailed analysis, I aim to extract valuable insights that can shed light on the impact of COVID-19 on the European Stock Market, providing a comprehensive understanding of the market dynamics during this period.

## Outline

* Importing the data
    - installing yfinance library
    - creating a dataframe
* Exploratory Data Analysis

## Importing the data

To import stock data, we will use a Python library called `yfinance`, which provides a convenient way for pulling different financial data from various online sources such as Yahoo Finance, and putting all these data into a Pandas DataFrame.
